# MovieListApplication - Clean Architecture MVVM

A simple project using [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) based on Kotlin MVVM architecture and material designs.
We will use clean architecture to achieve below goals so our business logic is completely decoupled from our UI. It makes our code very easy to maintain and test.

## The Goal
* Visualize the movie list in different sections i.e. now playing, most popular, top rated and upcoming as a vertical list with collapsible toolbar
* Vertical list should have 4 collapsible sections, each with title and horizontally scrollable list
* We will integrate following APIs in each collapsible sections as horizontal list in order:

  * [Latest movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing)

  * [Popular movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies)

  * [Top Rated movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-top-rated-movies)

  * [Upcoming movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-upcoming)
    
* To showcase UI we will populate the first two sections when user lands on Main screen keeping other two in collapsed state but show the section title. Each item in the horizontal list should have movie image and the movie title.

* We will fetch data for third and fourth section when user clicks to expand any of those sections. 

* User should be able to collapse, expanded section and vice versa from the section title bar.
* Clicking on any item in horizontal list should open item details bottom sheet.
